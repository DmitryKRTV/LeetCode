# https://leetcode.com/problems/running-sum-of-1d-array/

# Given an array nums. We define a running sum of an array as runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]â€¦nums[i]).

# Return the running sum of nums.

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
# Output: [1,3,6,10]
# Explanation: Running sum is obtained as follows: [1, 1+2, 1+2+3, 1+2+3+4].

class Solution:
    def runningSum(self, nums: list[int]) -> list[int]:
        return [sum(nums[:(i + 1)]) for i in range(len(nums))]
    
sol = Solution()
print(sol.runningSum([1,2,3]))
